TODO: Make this more in-depth.

The following guidelines to contributing to this project should be followed:

1. The root directory should be a blank template without any example code.
2. All example projects should go in the `examples` directory.
3. Make should be used for file compilation (synthesis, place-and-route, etc).
4. Python 2.7 should be used for all other scripts (source file generation, flashing, etc).
